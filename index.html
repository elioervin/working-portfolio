					<p class="intro">Welcome to my Portfolio Page! I'm a Software Engineering student at Thinkful based out of San Francisco

                    </p>
                     <p>
                        Front-end developer with experience in html, css,javascript, react, & node.
                        Graduating from Thinkful software development full-time program in April 2021. I have 10 years experience working in Sales and SaaS which have given me the skills to work in teams, create and execute plans, resolve issues, communicate effectively. Thinkful has given me a passion for writing clean, well-documented, and reusable code. The intensity of the bootcamp prepared me to quickly develop expertise in any tech stack with little to no supervision.

			<div class='group'>
				<div class='item-double'>
          <p>I was laid off from my 3 jobs after CoVID 19 shelter-in-place orders swept the country and San Francisco. I decided to make a career change and enrolled in Thinkful’s Software Engineering Immersion course with an expected Graduation date of April 2021. I’m looking forward to using my skills to promote positive changes within my community and bringing technology to organizations that might not have had access otherwise.</p>

          <p> I enjoy working in teams and leading groups and have done so most of my life. I started playing in an orchestra around 9 years old and played sports. I enjoy contributing to a group effort as a part of the team or as a leader. Teamwork is ingrained in my core ideas and concepts of life. I am super excited about the challenges ahead and can’t wait to get started with a new organization.</p>
